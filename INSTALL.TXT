         INSTALLATION OF MTOOLS
---------------------------------------------

The mtools library uses several C++11 specific constructs as well 
as the new headers in the STL so you need a recent compiler to 
build it. It also depends a few other libraries cross platform
libraries:

	- CImg (http://cimg.eu)
	- fltk (http://www.fltk.org)
	- zlib (http://www.zlib.net)
	- libpng (http://www.libpng.org)
	- libjpeg (http://www.libpng.org)

----------------------
     On windows
----------------------
[tested on Windows 7 with VS2015RC]

You must first install the libraries above before compiling mtools. 
Since FLTK already bundles zlib, libpng and libjpeg, it suffices 
to install fltk and CImg. The visual studio solution/project files 
define both 32bit and 64bit configurations hence every library 
should also provide binaries for both platform. 

1) Download fltk (http://www.fltk.org), version 1.3.3 or above. 

2) Build fltk, fltkdll, fltkimages, fltkzlib, fltkpng, fltkjpeg for 
32bit in Release and Debug. Normally, the binaries are put in FLTK's 
lib/ subdirectory.

3) Create a new directory lib32/ at the root of the FLTK source tree 
and move the content of lib/ to this new directory. add also 
fltkdll.dll  and fltkdlld.dll to lib32/ (these are not by default in 
the /lib directory). The directory should therefore contain at least: 
fltk.lib, fltkd.lib, fltkdll.lib, fltkdlld.lib, fltkdll.dll, 
fltkdlld.dll, fltkimages, fltkimagesd, fltkjpeg.lib, fltkjpegd.lib, 
fltkpng.lib, fltkpngd.lib, fltkzlib.lib, fltkzlib

4) Repeat the same step building the libraries for 64bit and then, again, 
move all the binaries to a directory named lib64/ at the root of the FLTK 
source tree.

5) Define an global environment variable 'FLTK_LIB' in Windows pointing 
to FLTK root directory. Normally, this directory should contain at least 
the following sub directories:
                 - /FL/   with the FLTK headers
                 - /zlib/ with the zlib headers
                 - /png/  with the libpng headers
                 - /jpeg/ with the libjpeg headers
                 - /lib32/ with the binaries (32 bit)
                 - /lib64/ with the binaries (64 bit)

6) download CImg (http://cimg.eu) version 1.6.3 or higher. There is nothing
to install, just put the CImg folder wherever you please and then define
the environement variable 'CIMG_LIB' in Windows so that it points to the 
CImg directory.

5) open the mtools.sln file at the root of the mtools source tree with 
VS2105 and build each versions of the library. Hopefully this should work...

NOTE: On windows, programs making use of the mtools::cout console object 
before main() even start (e.g. in constructors of global objects) should 
always link against the DLL version of fltk instead of the static library 
as it will insure that FLTK is always properly initialized before it is 
used. Otherwise, "static initialization fiasco" type problem may occur...



----------------------
      On Linux 
----------------------
[tested on a virtual machine with Arch-Linux and with gcc 5.1]

1) Make sure that the required libs (fltk, zlib, libpng, libjpeg and CImg) 
are installed on the system, up to date, and accessible (in /usr/...
or /usr/local/...)

2) Run 'make' in the linux/ sub-directory of the mtools tree and pray. 



----------------------
     On MacOS X
----------------------
Good luck to you ! (it should theorically work wihtout much trouble but I 
have never tried...)
